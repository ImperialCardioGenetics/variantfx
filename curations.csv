BAG3,DCM,familial dilated cardiomyopathy,MONDO:0005021;MONDO:0016333,Monoallelic_aut,"Truncating variants are responsible for the majority of BAG3-related DCM cases, the majority of which are nonsense and frameshift, and also include several single and multi-exon, and whole gene, deletion. ClinGen have concluded there is good evidence for haploinsufficiency. There is not yet evidence for dominant-negative effects."
DES,DCM,familial dilated cardiomyopathy,MONDO:0005021;MONDO:0016333,Monoallelic_aut,Pathogenic variants in DES cause DCM due altered gene product structure. Only missense variants in variants in DES have been confidently reported as pathogenic in DCM. 
DSP,DCM,familial dilated cardiomyopathy,MONDO:0005021;MONDO:0016333,Monoallelic_aut,"Pathogenic variants in DSP cause DCM due to decreased gene product level or altered gene product structure due to a variety of mechanisms including altered splicing of targets. A dominant negative effect causing disrupted RNA binding is also a possible/likely mechanism. Both missense and truncating mutations have been reported in DCM cases, however, there is significantly more evidence in support of truncating variants being pathogenic. Protein-truncating variants in constitutive exons (Percent Spliced In>90%) of DSP are significantly enriched in patients with DCM compared with healthy controls (Pubmed ID 31983221)."
FLNC,DCM,familial dilated cardiomyopathy,MONDO:0005021;MONDO:0016333,Monoallelic_aut,"Truncating variants (stop-gain, frameshift and splicing) are responsible for all reported cases of FLNC-related DCM to date, with no evidence that missense variants are causative. "
LMNA,DCM,familial dilated cardiomyopathy,MONDO:0005021;MONDO:0016333,Monoallelic_aut,"Pathogenic variants in LMNA cause DCM due to decreased/absent gene product level or altered gene product structure due to a variety of mechanisms including altered splicing of targets. Missense mutations are responsible for the majority of DCM cases although truncating variants (nonsense, frameshift and splice variants) have been reported. Loss of function via truncating variants is highly likely. "
MYH7,DCM,familial dilated cardiomyopathy,MONDO:0005021;MONDO:0016333,Monoallelic_aut,"Pathogenic variants in MYH7 cause DCM due to altered gene product structure.  Dominant-negative missense mutations resulting in an altered protein with reduced function are responsible for the vast majority of DCM cases, and a small number of in-frame indels have also been reported associated with disease. There is no good evidence that loss of function is a disease mechanism."
PLN,DCM,familial dilated cardiomyopathy,MONDO:0005021;MONDO:0016333,Monoallelic_aut,Pathogenic variants in PLN cause cardiomyopathy by decreased gene product level or altered gene product structure. In the Netherlands there is a founder mutation R14del. Up to 10-15% of both dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy patients are reported to be caused by PLN-R14del.
RBM20,DCM,familial dilated cardiomyopathy,MONDO:0005021;MONDO:0016333,Monoallelic_aut,"Pathogenic variants in RBM20 cause DCM due to decreased/absent gene product level or altered gene product structure due to a variety of mechanisms including altered splicing of targets. Missense mutations are responsible for the majority of DCM cases although a small number of truncating variants (nonsense) have been reported. Loss of function via truncating variants is not absolutely established, but highly likely. There is a mutation hotspot in exon 9 (RS motif, amino acids 634-638)."
SCN5A,DCM,familial dilated cardiomyopathy,MONDO:0005021;MONDO:0016333,Monoallelic_aut,Pathogenic variants in SCN5A cause DCM due to decreased gene product level or altered gene product structure due to a variety of mechanisms including altered splicing of targets. Missense mutations are responsible for the majority of DCM cases although a small number of truncating variants (splicing/nonsense/frameshift) have been reported.
TNNC1,DCM,familial dilated cardiomyopathy,MONDO:0005021;MONDO:0016333,Monoallelic_aut,"Missense variants are responsible for all reported cases of TNNC1-related DCM, with no evidence that truncating variants are causative of disease. "
TNNT2,DCM,familial dilated cardiomyopathy,MONDO:0005021;MONDO:0016333,Monoallelic_aut,Pathogenic variants in TNNT2 cause DCM due to altered gene product structure. Only missense mutations have confidently been reported as pathogenic in TNNT2 DCM cases. No reports of TNNT2 truncating variants causing DCM.
TTN,DCM,familial dilated cardiomyopathy,MONDO:0005021;MONDO:0016333,Monoallelic_aut,"Pathogenic variants in TTN cause an estimated 15-20% of familial DCM due to Decreased gene product level; absent gene product and altered gene product structure. The likely disease mechanism is loss of/reduced function; however, it is unclear whether this is due haploinsufficiency or a dominant negative effect. Truncating variants, specifically in exons constitutively expressed in cardiac tissue, are responsible for the vast majority of TTN-related DCM cases. Missense variants are difficult to interpret, and generally not classified as disease-causing, although there are also rare reports of pathogenic missense variant acting via a dominant negative effect."
ACTC1,HCM,familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,MONDO:0005045;MONDO:0024573,Monoallelic_aut,ACTC1 pathogenic variants cause HCM through altered gene product structure. Heterozygous missense mutations are the major type of pathogenic variants found. 
MYBPC3,HCM,familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,MONDO:0005045;MONDO:0024573,Monoallelic_aut,"MYBPC3 pathogenic variants cause HCM through decreased gene product level or altered gene product structure. Majority of variants are heterozygous frameshift, nonsense, or splice site variants that result in premature termination codons. Missense and in frame indels are also frequently reported. While variants in MYBPC3 affecting canonical splice site dinucleotides are a well-characterised cause of HCM, recent work has identified more deeply intronic variants associated with disease."
MYH7,HCM,familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,MONDO:0005045;MONDO:0024573,Monoallelic_aut,MYH7 pathogenic variants cause HCM through altered gene product structure. Most pathogenic variants are missense. There are some in frame deletions reported. MYH7 loss of function (LOF) variants are very rare and their contribution to inherited cardiomyopathy is incompletely understood.
MYL2,HCM,familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,MONDO:0005045;MONDO:0024573,Monoallelic_aut,MYL2 pathogenic variants cause autosomal HCM through altered gene product structure. Mechanism is not definitively known. The majority of variants reported are missense.
MYL3,HCM,familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,MONDO:0005045;MONDO:0024573,Monoallelic_aut,MYL3 pathogenic variants cause HCM through altered gene product structure. Heterozygous missense variants are the major type of pathogenic variants found. There is currently insufficient evidence to support loss of function as a mechanism.
TNNI3,HCM,familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,MONDO:0005045;MONDO:0024573,Monoallelic_aut,TNNI3 pathogenic variants cause HCM through altered gene product structure. Heterozygous missense variants are the major type of pathogenic variants found. There are also reports of in frame deletions. 
TNNT2,HCM,familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,MONDO:0005045;MONDO:0024573,Monoallelic_aut,"TNNT2 pathogenic variants cause HCM through altered gene product structure. The mechanism appears to be dominant negative rather than haploinsufficiency. Nearly all pathogenic variants are missense. However, there are a few reports of in frame deletions, nonsense variants in the final exon which likely escape nonsense mediated decay and splice donor variants."
TPM1,HCM,familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,MONDO:0005045;MONDO:0024573,Monoallelic_aut,TPM1 pathogenic variants cause HCM through altered gene product structure. The mechanism is through altered function rather than haploinsufficiency. Pathogenic variants are nearly always heterozygous missense variants.
