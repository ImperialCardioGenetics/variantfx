The PM1 rule can be applied to variants located in a region defined as “a mutational hotspot and/or critical and well established functional domain”, according to the 2015 ACMG/AMP guidelines for sequence variant interpretation (PMID 25741868, link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25741868/)

“Certain protein domains are known to be critical to protein function and all missense variants identified to date in these domains have been shown to be pathogenic. These domains must also lack benign variants. In addition, mutational hotspots in less well characterized regions of genes are reported in which pathogenic variants in one or several nearby residues have been observed with greater frequency. Either evidence can be considered moderate evidence of pathogenicity.”

For genes associated with inherited cardiac conditions, we highlight regions in which rare variants have a high likelihood of pathogenicity, and where PM1 may be applicable. These have principally been ascertained using case-control comparisons in large cohorts, though the precise methods by which regions have been defined vary between diseases.
