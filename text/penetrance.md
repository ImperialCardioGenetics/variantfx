Population penetrance estimates are calculated using multiple sources of genetic data, as described in _The penetrance of rare variants in cardiomyopathy-associated genes: a cross-sectional approach to estimate penetrance for secondary findings_ (McGurk, et al., 2023)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10502871/]

Penetrance, the probability of a disease given a risk allele, is expressed as a probability function on a scale of 0â€“1 or as a percentage. Penetrance was estimated through a cross-sectional approach by using a method that compares the allele frequency of individual rare variants in large cohorts of affected individuals with the background frequency of the same variants in the population. We define penetrance in this setting as the probability of dominant cardiomyopathy by late adulthood.
