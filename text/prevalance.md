Estimated prevalence of all causes of disease in adult population is calculated using multiple sources of data, as described in _The penetrance of rare variants in cardiomyopathy-associated genes: a cross-sectional approach to estimate penetrance for secondary findings_ (McGurk, et al., 2023)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10502871/])

To estimate the prevalence of all-cause HCM in adults of the general population, a literature review and meta-analysis was completed of imaging studies in populations, where echocardiogram or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was used to identify HCM within a representative population sample. To estimate the prevalence of all-cause DCM in adults of the general population, we used 39,003 participants from the UK Biobank with cardiac MRI imaging to estimate phenotypic DCM. A literature review revealed insufficient imaging-based estimates to undertake a direct meta-analysis of the prevalence of DCM.

HCM: 1 in 543 individuals (0.18% [95% CI = 0.15%–0.23%])
1 in 1,300 females (0.08% [95% CI = 0.04%–0.12%]) and 1 in 360 males (0.28% [95% CI = 0.22%–0.35%])

DCM: 1 in 220 individuals (0.45% [95% CI = 0.39%–0.53%])
1 in 340 females (0.30% [95% CI = 0.23%–0.38%]) and 1 in 160 males (0.63% [95% CI = 0.52%–0.75%])
